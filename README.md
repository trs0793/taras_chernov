Hello, my name is Taras.

I am a data analyst actively seeking employment. I chose the profession of a data analyst because:

- I enjoy identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a company and its products.
- I analyze and determine the probable causes of these strengths and weaknesses.
- I uncover patterns.
- I find insights and growth points for products.
- I strive to enhance existing products and company processes.

I happily enrich my knowledge base by attending lectures on statistics, A/B testing, and variance reduction by Anatoliy Karpov. I have a passion for active sports and engage in CrossFit, which instills in me the fearlessness to take on complex and challenging tasks and achieve results.
